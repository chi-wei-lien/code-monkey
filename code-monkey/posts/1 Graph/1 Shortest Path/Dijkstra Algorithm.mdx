Dijkstra's algorithm is a fundamental algorithm used to find the shortest path in a graph where all edge weights are **non-negative**. Below, you'll find a template for implementing the algorithm. If you're new to Dijkstra's algorithm, I recommend starting with a basic understanding of its concept. Here are two excellent resources to help you get started:

- [Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm - A Detailed and Visual Introduction](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-visual-introduction/) by _freeCodeCamp_
- [Dijkstra on sparse graphs](https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/dijkstra_sparse.html) by _Algorithms for Competitive Programming_

This post focuses on the general idea of Dijkstra's algorithm and provides a template for practice and memorization. If you're unfamiliar with Python syntax, check out this [cheatsheet](/algo-guide/Python%20Coding%20Interview%20Cheat%20Sheet) for an overview of essential syntax.

Key Points about Dijkstra's Algorithm and This Template:

- Works only with non-negative weights: Dijkstra's algorithm is not reliable if the graph contains negative edge weights.
- Time complexity of this template: <InlineCode>O((E + V) \* log(E))</InlineCode>
  - Curious about why? Consider researching the algorithm's heap-based implementation.
- Optimal time complexity: When implemented with a Fibonacci heap, Dijkstra achieves <InlineCode>O(V \* log(V) + E)</InlineCode>.
  - However, this is rarely practical in interviews due to its complexity.
- Space complexity of this template: <InlineCode>O(E + V)</InlineCode>

# How to Memorize

- Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm.
- We only process a node once we've already computed the shortest distance to reach it.
- A priority queue (min heap) is used to efficiently retrieve the node with the shortest distance.
- We ensure that the node and distance popped from the priority queue are not outdated:
  - Why? A node can be pointed to by multiple other nodes. This means there can be multiple entries in the heap referring to the same node, but only one of these entries contains the correct (shortest) distance.
  - This check is done with the line: <InlineCode>if curr_dist != dist_to_reach_node[curr_node]: continue</InlineCode>
