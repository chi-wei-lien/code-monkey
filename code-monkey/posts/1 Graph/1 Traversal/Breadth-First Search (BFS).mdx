Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a traversal algorithm that explores a graph layer by layer. This makes it useful for finding the shortest path between two nodes, as long as all edge weights are equal and there are no negative-weight edges. If that sounds confusing, don’t worry—we'll cover more advanced shortest-path algorithms in the future.

If you're new to BFS, here are two excellent resources to get started:

# BFS Template

```python
from collections import deque

""" Example adjacency list """
adj_list = {
    0: [1, 2],  # Node 1 and 2 are adjacent to node 0
    1: [3],
    2: [3, 4],
    3: [5],
    4: [5],
    5: []
}

def bfs(adj_list):
    bfs_queue = deque([0])  # Initialize the queue with the starting node
    visited = set([0])

    while bfs_queue:
        layer_len = len(bfs_queue)
        for _ in range(layer_len):
            front = bfs_queue.popleft()

            """ Add your custom logic here; in this example, we print the node value """
            print(front, end=" ")

            for neighbor in adj_list[front]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    bfs_queue.append(neighbor)
                    visited.add(neighbor)

        print()  # Print a new line after processing each layer

bfs(adj_list)

""" Output:
0
1 2
3 4
5
"""
```

# BFS Template (Finding Shortest Path)

```python
from collections import deque

""" Example adjacency list """
adj_list = {
    0: [1, 2],
    1: [3],
    2: [3, 4],
    3: [5],

    5: []
}

def bfs_shortest_path(adj_list, a, b):  # Find the shortest path between nodes a and b
    bfs_queue = deque([a])  # Initialize the queue with the starting node
    visited = set([a])
    length = 0

    while bfs_queue:
        layer_len = len(bfs_queue)
        for _ in range(layer_len):
            front = bfs_queue.popleft()

            if front == b:
                return length

            for neighbor in adj_list[front]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    bfs_queue.append(neighbor)
                    visited.add(neighbor)

        length += 1

    return -1  # Return -1 if node a cannot reach node b

print(bfs_shortest_path(adj_list, 0, 5))

""" Output:

Key Points about BFS and this Template:

- Some BFS templates omit the <InlineCode>layer_len</InlineCode> variable and its associated loop. However, this variable is crucial for distinguishing layers. Without it, we wouldn't know when to increment the <InlineCode>length</InlineCode> variable (e.g., <InlineCode>length += 1</InlineCode>).
- The time complexity of BFS is <InlineCode>O(V + E)</InlineCode>, where <InlineCode>V</InlineCode> is the total number of nodes, and <InlineCode>E</InlineCode> is the total number of edges.

## How to Memorize

- Breadth-First Search explores nodes layer by layer.
- A **queue** is used to manage nodes during traversal.
- Use a variable like <InlineCode>layer_len</InlineCode> to track the number of nodes in the current layer, helping you identify when the layer ends.
