Welcome to the "Interview Guide" section! This page covers the essential data structures and algorithms you need to know for online assessments and coding interviews. Many posts focus on providing templates to help you memorize key concepts rather than teaching everything from scratch. If there's a topic not covered in the posts, I'll do my best to include helpful resources for further study. Happy coding, and good luck with your interview preparation!

Since the website is still under development, if you notice a bug, feel free to open an issue on GitHub. The project is open source, and you're more than welcome to contribute! Please send me an email at [chiweilien3124@gmail.com](mailto:chiweilien3124@gmail.com) beforehand so I know which part you want to work on.

  Lastly, here's a little about me! My name is Willy (formal name: Chi-Wei
  Lien). I graduated from Purdue University in 2024 with a degree in Computer
  Science. During my undergrad years, I spent a lot of time preparing for coding
  interviews and wanted to make the process easier for others. That's why I
  created this website. Hopefully, by the end of 2025, we'll have completed most
  of the key features of Code Monkey!
