If you're just getting started with technical interview prep and don't have a strong preference for a programming language, I highly recommend using Python. Here are three simple reasons why:

1. Its syntax is simple, easy to memorize, and concise.
2. Python's error messages are much easier to understand compared to C++ error messages (in my experience).
3. Most interviews and online assessments allow you to use Python.

Now that you're convinced, here's a cheatsheet to help you transition to coding in Python. Please note that this is not a comprehensive guide to writing Python code, but rather a handy reference covering the most common syntax used in technical interviews. I hope you find it helpful!

# Control flow

## For loop

If you want to iterate from a starting value to an ending value, you can use a <InlineCode>for</InlineCode> loop with the <InlineCode>range()</InlineCode> function. Here's how it works:

```python
start_val = 1
end_val = 5
step = 2

""" Loop from start_val to end_val (inclusive) """
for i in range(start_val, end_val + 1):
    print(i)

""" Output
1
2
3
4
5
"""

""" Loop from start_val to end_val with a step size """
for i in range(start_val, end_val + 1, step):
    print(i)

""" Output
1
3
5
"""

""" Loop from 0 to a given value (exclusive) if only one parameter is provided """
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

""" Output
0
1
2
"""

""" Loop in reverse (counting down) using a negative step """
for i in range(5, -1, -1):
    print(i)

""" Output
5
4
3
2
1
0
```

<ImportantMessage>
  Notice that the second parameter of the <InlineCode>range()</InlineCode>{" "}
  function is **exclusive**. This means the loop stops before reaching the
  specified <InlineCode>end_val</InlineCode>. To include
  <InlineCode>end_val</InlineCode> in the loop, you must add
  <InlineCode>+1</InlineCode> to it.
</ImportantMessage>

## Iterating over a list

Here are three common ways to iterate over a list. Using <InlineCode>enumerate()</InlineCode> is particularly helpful when you need both the index and the current item.

```python
animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'rabbit']

""" Method 1: Using enumerate() to get both index and item """
for index, animal in enumerate(animals):
    print(f"Index: {index}, Animal: {animal}")

""" Output
Index: 0, Animal: dog
Index: 1, Animal: cat
Index: 2, Animal: rabbit
"""

""" Method 2: Using range() and len() """
for i in range(len(animals)):
    print(animals[i])

""" Output
dog
cat
rabbit
"""

""" Method 3: Direct iteration over the list """
for animal in animals:
    print(animal)

""" Output
dog
cat
rabbit
"""
```

## While loop

The <InlineCode>while</InlineCode> loop in Python works similarly to other programming languages. It repeatedly executes the block of code as long as the condition evaluates to <InlineCode>True</InlineCode>.

```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1

""" Output
0
1
2
3
4
```

# Sorting

By default, sorting a list in Python arranges the elements in ascending (non-decreasing) order.

<ImportantMessage>
  Sorting in Python takes *O(nlogn)* time and *O(n)* space!
</ImportantMessage>

```python
""" Using the sort() method to modify the original list """
nums1 = [2, 3, 1, 5, 2]
nums1.sort()
print(nums1)

""" Output
[1, 2, 2, 3, 5]
"""

""" Using the sorted() function to return a new sorted list """
nums2 = [2, 3, 1, 5, 2]
sorted_nums = sorted(nums2)
print(sorted_nums)

""" Output
[1, 2, 2, 3, 5]
"""
```

<ImportantMessage>
  Notice the difference: <InlineCode>sorted()</InlineCode> returns a **new**
  sorted list, while
  <InlineCode>sort()</InlineCode> modifies the original list in place. Personally,
  I prefer using
  <InlineCode>sorted()</InlineCode> for clarity. However, during an interview,
  always ask if modifying the original list is acceptable. For the sake of
  simplicity, I will use
  <InlineCode>sorted()</InlineCode> in the remaining examples.
</ImportantMessage>

## Sorting a list of collections

Sometimes, our list can be more complex, such as a list of collections. Here, a collection refers to another list or a tuple. The important thing to understand is that, by default, Python will compare the first element of each collection to determine the order. If there's a tie, it will compare the second element, and if there's still a tie, it moves on to the third element, and so on.

```python
nums = [(5, 2), (1, 3), (2, 6), (2, 4)]
sorted_nums = sorted(nums)
print(sorted_nums)

""" Output
[(1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (5, 2)]
"""
```

## Sorting a list with custom comparison function

Sometimes, you may need a custom comparison function. For example, if you want to sort a list based on the sum of each collection within it, you can use the key parameter in the <InlineCode>sorted()</InlineCode> function to define your custom logic.

```python
nums = [(5, 2), (1, 3), (2, 6), (2, 4)]

""" Sorting based on the sum of elements in each tuple (ascending order) """
sorted_nums = sorted(nums, key=lambda x: x[0] + x[1])
print(sorted_nums)

""" Output
[(1, 3), (2, 4), (5, 2), (2, 6)]
"""
```

<ImportantMessage>

What if you want to sort in descending (non-increasing) order?

```python
nums = [(5, 2), (1, 3), (2, 6), (2, 4)]

""" Sorting based on the sum of elements in each tuple (descending order) """
sorted_nums = sorted(nums, key=lambda x: -(x[0] + x[1]))
print(sorted_nums)

""" Output
[(2, 6), (5, 2), (2, 4), (1, 3)]
"""
```

A simple negative sign in the <InlineCode>lambda</InlineCode> function is all you need! :D

</ImportantMessage>

# Basic data structure

## Array

In Python, arrays are implemented as lists, which are mutable collections of data.

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(nums)

""" Output
[1, 2, 3, 4]
"""

all_zeros = [0] * 4
print(all_zeros)

""" Output
[0, 0, 0, 0]
"""
```

### 2D Array

To create a 2D array in Python, you can use a list comprehension to generate rows and columns.

```python
rows = 2
cols = 3
arr = [[0 for col in range(cols)] for row in range(rows)]
print(arr)

""" Output
arr = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
"""
```

<ImportantMessage>
  You cannot use <InlineCode>arr = ([0] * cols) * rows</InlineCode> to create a
  2D array! This method will create references to the same inner list, which can
  lead to unexpected behavior.
</ImportantMessage>

### Copying and extracting from array

In Python, copying and extracting parts of an array (or list) is simple using slicing with the colon operator.

```python
nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
nums2 = nums1  # This makes nums2 refer to the same list as nums1
nums3 = nums1[:]  # Creates a new copy of nums1

nums1[0] = 5  # Modifying nums1

print("nums1:", nums1)  # nums1 is modified
print("nums2:", nums2)  # nums2 refers to the same list as nums1, so it changes too
print("nums3:", nums3)  # nums3 remains the original copy of nums1

""" Output
nums1: [5, 2, 3, 4]
nums2: [5, 2, 3, 4]
nums3: [1, 2, 3, 4]
"""
```

You can also extract parts of a list (slice) using the colon operator:

```python
nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
part_of_nums1 = nums1[1:3]  # Extracts elements from index 1 to index 2 (exclusive of index 3)
print("part_of_nums1:", part_of_nums1)

""" Output
part_of_nums1: [2, 3]
"""
```

<ImportantMessage>

You can also omit the start or end index:

- <InlineCode>nums[:3]</InlineCode> extracts from the beginning up to index 3 (exclusive).
- <InlineCode>nums[2:]</InlineCode> extracts from index 2 to the end of the list.
- <InlineCode>nums[::2]</InlineCode> extracts every second element (step size of
  2).

</ImportantMessage>

## String

Strings in Python are a collection of characters, but they come with a few important caveats:

- Strings are immutable: You cannot modify the character at a particular index. For example, attempting to do <InlineCode>my_string[0] = 'A'</InlineCode> will raise an error.
- No separate character type: In Python, there is no distinct character data type. Characters are simply single-character strings. For example, <InlineCode>'a'</InlineCode> is a string, not a character.
- String concatenation is costly: Concatenating strings directly using the <InlineCode>+=</InlineCode> operator takes O(n) time because a new string is created each time, which can be inefficient in loops or with large strings. Instead, it is often better to accumulate parts in a list and then join them into a single string using <InlineCode>''.join()</InlineCode>.

### Split

You can split a string into a list of words (or substrings) based on a delimiter:

```python
my_sentence = "Hello how are you?"
my_chars = my_sentence.split(' ')  # Splitting by space
print(my_chars)

""" Output
['Hello', 'how', 'are', 'you?']
"""
```

### Join

Joining a list of strings into a single string can be done efficiently using the <InlineCode>join()</InlineCode> method:

```python
animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'fish']
animals_str1 = ', '.join(animals)
print(animals_str1)

""" Output
dog, cat, fish
"""
```

### String Concatenation

Direct string concatenation using += can be inefficient because each concatenation operation involves creating a new string. Here's an example illustrating this:

```python
str_1 = "abc"  # Initial string

""" Concatenating with += takes O(n) time per operation """
str_1 += 'a'  # Takes O(n)
str_1 += 'b'  # Takes O(n)
str_1 += 'c'  # Takes O(n)

""" In total, the three concatenations will take 3n time """
```

### Optimized Concatenation

Instead of using <InlineCode>+=</InlineCode>, you can accumulate strings in a list and join them at the end. This method avoids repeatedly copying the entire string and is much more efficient:

```python
str_arr = ['abc']
str_arr.append('a')
str_arr.append('b')
str_arr.append('c')
result = ''.join(str_arr)  # Join the list into a single string

""" This will only take n time, which is more efficient than multiple += """
```

## Stack (LIFO)

A stack is a last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structure. In Python, there isn't a built-in stack data structure, but most people use a <InlineCode>deque</InlineCode> ([double-ended queue]()) from the <InlineCode>collections</InlineCode> module to mimic a stack. For more information on stacks and their time complexities, please refer to the [Algo guide on stacks].

```python
from collections import deque

arr = [1, 2, 3]
stack = deque([])

""" Pushing items onto the stack """
for item in arr:
    stack.append(item)

""" Popping items from the stack """
while stack:
    print(stack.pop(), end=" ")

""" Output
3 2 1
"""
```

## Queue (FIFO)

A queue is a first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure. Similar to a stack, there isn't a built-in queue data structure in Python, but most people use a <InlineCode>deque</InlineCode> (double-ended queue) from the <InlineCode>collections</InlineCode> module to mimic a queue. For more information on queues and their time complexities, please refer to the [Algo guide on queues].

```python
from collections import deque

arr = [1, 2, 3]
queue = deque([])

""" Enqueue items """
for item in arr:
    queue.append(item)

""" Dequeue items """
while queue:
    print(queue.popleft(), end=" ")

""" Output
1 2 3
"""
```

## Deque

A deque (short for double-ended queue) is a data structure that allows elements to be added or removed from both ends efficiently. In Python, deques are implemented using a doubly linked list, making these operations fast. Common operations on a deque include:

- Adding elements to the left (appendleft) or right (append).
- Removing elements from the left (popleft) or right (pop).

```python
from collections import deque

my_deque = deque([1, 2, 0])

my_deque.append(5) # push to the right
my_deque.appendleft(2) # push to the left
print(my_deque)
""" Output
deque([2, 1, 2, 0, 5])
"""

my_deque.pop() # pop from the right
print(my_deque)
""" Output
deque([2, 1, 2, 0])
"""

my_deque.popleft() # pop from the left
print(my_deque)
""" Output
deque([1, 2, 0])
"""
```

## Hashmap

Hashmaps allow fast lookups using a key. In Python, they are called dictionaries. Personally, I prefer using <InlineCode>defaultdict</InlineCode> over a traditional dictionary. You can read more about <InlineCode>defaultdict</InlineCode> in [Hashmap with initial value](#hashmap-with-initial-value).

```python
hashmap = {}
key = 0
value = 1

""" Adding a key-value pair to the hashmap """
hashmap[key] = value
print(hashmap)

""" Output
{0: 1}
"""

""" Checking if a key is present in the hashmap """
print(key in hashmap)
""" Output
True
"""

""" Removing a key-value pair """
hashmap.pop(key)
print(key in hashmap)
""" Output
False
"""

""" Accessing a key that doesn't exist will raise a KeyError """
try:
    print(hashmap[3])
except KeyError:
    print("Key not found!")

""" Output
Key not found!
"""
```

### Hashmap with initial value

Looking up a non-existing key can sometimes be annoying, especially in cases where you need to check if the key exists, and if not, initialize its value. Consider the following scenario: you want to count how many times each letter appears in a string. While iterating through the string, you would normally check if the current character exists in the dictionary. If it does, you increment its value, and if it doesn't, you initialize the value. However, you can simplify this process using a <InlineCode>defaultdict</InlineCode>.

A <InlineCode>defaultdict</InlineCode> automatically initializes the value when a key does not exist, based on the default value you provide in the <InlineCode>lambda</InlineCode>.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

""" Create a defaultdict with default value 0 """
hashmap = defaultdict(lambda: 0)

hashmap['a'] += 1
print(hashmap['a'])  # This will return 1
print(hashmap['b'])  # This will return 0, since 'b' doesn't exist yet

""" Removing a key from the hashmap """
hashmap.pop('b')
```

<ImportantMessage>
  The key used in **both** dictionaries and <InlineCode>defaultdict</InlineCode>{" "}
  must be hashable. Hashable types include <InlineCode>int</InlineCode>,{" "}
  <InlineCode>float</InlineCode>, <InlineCode>string</InlineCode>,{" "}
  <InlineCode>boolean</InlineCode>, and <InlineCode>tuple</InlineCode>. It's
  important to note that tuples are hashable, while lists are not. This is
  because tuples are immutable (you can't change their elements once they are
  created), while lists are mutable. Strings, being immutable, are also
  hashable, and we will discuss them more in the [string section](#string).
</ImportantMessage>

### Iterating over hashmap

The two most common ways to iterate over a dictionary or a <InlineCode>defaultdict</InlineCode> are as follows:

Method 1: using <InlineCode>.items()</InlineCode>

```python
from collections import defaultdict

""" traditionaly dictionary """
my_dict = {
    'a': 1,
    'b': 2,
    'c': 1
}

""" Initialize a defaultdict with a normal dictionary """
my_default_dict = defaultdict(int, my_dict)

""" Iterating over the defaultdict """
for key, value in my_default_dict.items():
    print(key, value)

""" Output
a 1
b 2
c 1
"""
```

Method 2: accessing keys directly

```python
from collections import defaultdict

""" traditionaly dictionary """
my_dict = {
    'a': 1,
    'b': 2,
    'c': 1
}

""" Initialize a defaultdict with a normal dictionary """
my_default_dict = defaultdict(int, my_dict)

""" Iterating over the defaultdict """
for key in my_default_dict:
    print(key, my_default_dict[key])

""" Output
a 1
b 2
c 1
"""
```

## Hashset

Hashsets are called **sets** in Python. They allow you to perform fast lookups from a collection of unique elements (no duplicates).

```python
""" Creating a set with an initial element """
hashset = set([2])
item = 1

""" Adding an item to the set """
hashset.add(item)
print(hashset)

""" Output
{1, 2}
"""

""" Checking if an item exists in the set """
print(item in hashset)
""" Output
True
"""

""" Removing an item from the set """
hashset.remove(item)
print(hashset)

""" Output
{2}
"""
```

## Heap

By default, all heaps in Python are min-heaps, meaning that the smallest element is returned when you call <InlineCode>heappop()</InlineCode>.

```python
import heapq

arr1 = [1, 3, 2, 5, 4]
heapq.heapify(arr1)  # Convert arr1 into a min heap

minHeap = []
arr2 = [1, 5, 9, 10, 7]
for item in arr2:
    heapq.heappush(minHeap, item)  # Push items into the min heap

while minHeap:
    popped = heapq.heappop(minHeap)  # Pop from min heap (get the smallest item)
    print(popped, end=" ")

""" Output
1 5 7 9 10
"""
```

<ImportantMessage>
  If you already have a list of elements that you want to convert into a heap,
  using the <InlineCode>heapq.heapify()</InlineCode> function is the fastest
  method, with a time complexity of O(n). In contrast, adding elements one by
  one using <InlineCode>heappush()</InlineCode>
  has a time complexity of O(n log n).
</ImportantMessage>

### Max (Custom) Heap

There are generally two methods to create a max heap in Python.

1. Using a Min Heap with Reversed Elements

You can still use a min heap by pushing the negative (reversed) value of each element to simulate a max heap. When popping from the heap, reverse the value again.

```python
import heapq

min_heap = []
arr = [1, 5, 9, 10, 7]
for item in arr:
    heapq.heappush(min_heap, -item)  # Push the negative value to the min heap

while min_heap:
    popped = -heapq.heappop(min_heap)  # Pop from min heap and reverse the value
    print(popped, end=" ")

""" Output
10 9 7 5 1
"""
```

2. Using a Custom Object with the <InlineCode>**lt**()</InlineCode> Comparison Function

You can also create a custom object with the <InlineCode>**lt**()</InlineCode> method to define how the elements should be compared. This method is more flexible but more complex.

```python
import heapq

class HeapObject:
    """ Constructor with additional values if needed """
    def __init__(self, value1, value2):
        self.value1 = value1
        self.value2 = value2

    def __lt__(self, other):
        """ To make it a max heap, we use greater than comparison """
        return self.get_value() > other.get_value()

        """ To make it a min heap, we use less than comparison
        return self.get_value() < other.get_value() """

    def get_value(self):
        """ Customize this method as needed """
        return self.value1 + self.value2


min_heap = []
arr = [(1, 2), (1, 7), (2, 4)]
for a, b in arr:
    heapq.heappush(min_heap, HeapObject(a, b))  # Push custom objects to the heap

while min_heap:
    popped = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
    print(popped.get_value(), end=" ")

""" Output
8 6 3
"""
```

## Graph

There are two common graph representations: the adjacency list and adjacency matrix.

### Adjacent List (Unweighted)

The following example demonstrates an unweighted graph where edges have no weights.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

edges = [
    [0, 1],
    [2, 3],
    [0, 4],
    [2, 4]
]
adj_list = defaultdict(lambda: [])  # Using defaultdict to create an empty list for each node

for n1, n2 in edges:
    adj_list[n1].append(n2)  # Add directed edge from n1 to n2
    """ If the graph is undirected, add the reverse edge too
    adj_list[n2].append(n1) """

for v, adj in adj_list.items():
    print(f"{v} -> {adj}")

""" Output
0 -> [1, 4]
2 -> [3, 4]
"""
```

### Adjacent List (Weighted)

For a weighted graph, each edge contains a weight, which is added along with the destination node.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

edges = [
    # n1, n2, weight
    [0, 1, 5],
    [2, 3, 2],
    [0, 4, 7],
    [2, 4, 9]
]
adj_list = defaultdict(lambda: [])  # Using defaultdict to create an empty list for each node

for n1, n2, weight in edges:
    adj_list[n1].append((n2, weight))  # Add weighted edge (n2, weight)
    """ If the graph is undirected, add the reverse edge too
    adj_list[n2].append((n1, weight)) """

for v, adj in adj_list.items():
    print(f"{v} -> {adj}")

""" Output
0 -> [(1, 5), (4, 7)]
2 -> [(3, 2), (4, 9)]
"""
```

### Adjacent Matrix

An adjacency matrix is a 2D array used to represent a graph, where each cell <InlineCode>adj_matrix[i][j]</InlineCode> holds the weight of the edge from node <InlineCode>i</InlineCode> to node <InlineCode>j</InlineCode>. For a graph with <InlineCode>n</InlineCode> nodes (labeled from 0 to <InlineCode>n - 1</InlineCode>), this matrix has dimensions <InlineCode>n x n</InlineCode>.

```python
n = 6  # Number of nodes

edges = [
    # n1, n2, weight
    [0, 1, 1],
    [2, 3, 2],
    [0, 4, 3],
    [2, 4, 5]
]

""" Initialize adjacency matrix with zeros """
adj_mat = [[0 for col in range(n)] for row in range(n)]

for n1, n2, weight in edges:
    adj_mat[n1][n2] = weight  # Add directed edge with weight
    """ If the graph is undirected, add the reverse edge too:
    adj_mat[n2][n1] = weight """

for row in range(n):
    print(adj_mat[row])

""" Output
[0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
"""
```
