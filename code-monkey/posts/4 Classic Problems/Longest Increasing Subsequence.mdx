This problem can be found on LeetCode: 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence. I encourage you to read the problem statement and try solving it on your own before continuing with this post.

# Solution 1: Dynamic Programming

```python
"""
Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(n)
"""
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [1] * n
        max_len = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[j] + 1, dp[i])
            max_len = max(max_len, dp[i])
        return max_len
```

If you're familiar with dynamic programming (DP), this solution might be intuitive. The key idea is to maintain a dp array where:

<InlineCode>dp[i]</InlineCode> stores the length of the longest increasing
subsequence that ends at index <InlineCode>i</InlineCode>. To compute
<InlineCode>dp[i]</InlineCode>, we iterate over all previous indices
<InlineCode>j</InlineCode> and check if
<InlineCode>nums[i] > nums[j]</InlineCode>. If so, we consider extending the
subsequence ending at <InlineCode>j</InlineCode> by including
<InlineCode>nums[i]</InlineCode>, giving a candidate length of
<InlineCode>dp[j] + 1</InlineCode>. We update
<InlineCode>dp[i]</InlineCode> by taking the maximum of these candidate lengths.
Finally, the result is the maximum value in the dp array.

# Solution 2: Building Sequence (Greedy)

```python
"""
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
"""
def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    lis = []
    n = len(nums)
    for i in range(n):
        l = 0
        r = len(lis) - 1
        res = -1
        while l <= r:
            mid = l + (r - l) // 2
            if lis[mid] >= nums[i]:
                res = mid
                r = mid - 1
            else:
                l = mid + 1
        if res == -1 or res >= len(lis):
            lis.append(nums[i])
        else:
            lis[res] = nums[i]
    return len(lis)
```

This approach is more challenging to come up with. The idea is to greedily build a sequence while ensuring we maintain the potential for the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). Instead of maintaining a valid LIS at every step, we build a sequence that helps us determine the correct length.

# Key Insight (Greedy Property)

> If we encounter a smaller element, replacing a larger element with it allows for more room to build a longer subsequence.

For example, consider the sequence <InlineCode>[0, 5, 2, ...]</InlineCode>. Keeping 5 would limit our ability to extend the sequence if a 3 appears later. Instead, replacing 5 with 2 increases the flexibility of the sequence.

Consider the array <InlineCode>[1, 4, 5, 2, 3]</InlineCode>.

We process elements one by one, maintaining an increasing sequence that may not be a valid LIS but helps track the potential length.
After processing 1, 4, 5, our sequence is <InlineCode>[1, 4, 5]</InlineCode>.
When we encounter 2, we replace 4 with 2, giving <InlineCode>[1, 2, 5]</InlineCode>. Although 2 originally appears after 5 in the input, this replacement doesn't affect the sequence length.
When 3 arrives, it replaces 5, forming <InlineCode>[1, 2, 3]</InlineCode>.
If a 6 appears next, we simply append it, forming <InlineCode>[1, 2, 3, 6]</InlineCode>.
Since we always maintain a valid sequence length while making these replacements, the length of the incr at the end gives the correct answer.
