Union Find (aka Disjoint Set) is an interesting data structure that allows you to join multiple sets into one in <InlineCode>O(1)</InlineCode> time and also lookup whether two nodes belong to the same set in <InlineCode>O(1)</InlineCode> time as well. Below, you'll find a template for implementing the data structure. If you're new to union find, I recommend starting with a basic understanding of its concept. Here is an excellent resources to help you get started:

This post focuses on the general idea of Union Find and provides a template for practice and memorization. If you're unfamiliar with Python syntax, check out this [cheatsheet](/algo-guide/Python%20Coding%20Interview%20Cheat%20Sheet) for an overview of essential syntax.

# General Idea

There are two functions in a union find data structure, <InlineCode>union()</InlineCode> and <InlineCode>find()</InlineCode>.

- <InlineCode>union(a, b)</InlineCode>: combine node
  <InlineCode>a</InlineCode> and node <InlineCode>b</InlineCode> into one set
- <InlineCode>find(a)</InlineCode>: each set is represented by one node,
  <InlineCode>find(a)</InlineCode> returns the node that represent the set
  <InlineCode>a</InlineCode> is in (this node could be
  <InlineCode>a</InlineCode> itself).

# Path Compression

When we do do <InlineCode>find(a)</InlineCode> we connect all the node along the path to reach the root node directly with the root node.

# Union by Rank

When we are joining two sets, ideally we want to put the smaller-height set underneath the larger-height set. When the two sets have the same size, the final size will be either size plus 1. It is important to understand that there is a difference between _rank_ and _height_. Rank is only the upperbound of height but not the actual height.

# Union Find Template

```python
n = 6 # given 6 nodes labeled 0 to 5
rank = [0] * n
parent = [i for i in range(n)]


def find(a):
  if parent[a] == a:
    return a
  parent[a] = find(parent[a]) # Path compression
  return parent[a]

def union(a, b):
  a_parent = find(a)
  b_parent = find(b)

  if a_parent == b_parent: # the two are already connected
    return

  """Union by rank: attach the tree with lower rank under the tree with higher rank"""
  if rank[a_parent] < rank[b_parent]:
      parent[a_parent] = b_parent
  elif rank[a_parent] > rank[b_parent]:
      parent[b_parent] = a_parent
  else:
      parent[b_parent] = a_parent  # If ranks are equal, make either one the root
      rank[a_parent] += 1  # Increment the rank of the root
```
