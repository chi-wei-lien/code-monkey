Union Find (aka Disjoint Set) is an interesting data structure that allows you to join multiple sets into one in <InlineCode>O(1)</InlineCode> time and also lookup whether two nodes belong to the same set in <InlineCode>O(1)</InlineCode> time as well. Below, you'll find a template for implementing the data structure. If you're new to union find, I recommend starting with a basic understanding of its concept. Here are two excellent resources to help you get started:

This post focuses on the general idea of Union Find and provides a template for practice and memorization. If you're unfamiliar with Python syntax, check out this [cheatsheet](/algo-guide/Python%20Coding%20Interview%20Cheat%20Sheet) for an overview of essential syntax.

# General Idea

There are two functions in a union find data structure, <InlineCode>union()</InlineCode> and <InlineCode>find()</InlineCode>.

- <InlineCode>union(a, b)</InlineCode>: combine node <InlineCode>
    a
  </InlineCode> and node <InlineCode>b</InlineCode> into one set
- <InlineCode>find(a)</InlineCode>: each set is represented by one node, <InlineCode>
    find(a)
  </InlineCode> returns the node that represent the set <InlineCode>
    a
  </InlineCode> is in (this node could be <InlineCode>
    a
  </InlineCode> itself).{" "}
