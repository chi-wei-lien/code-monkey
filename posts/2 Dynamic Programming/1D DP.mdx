There really isn't a single template that you can use to solve Dynamic Programming (DP) problems. Similar to Greedy, DP is an approach you can take to solve a problem. However, there is still a couple points I would like mention in this post. Again, if you have never heard of DP, here are two great resources for you to get started.
